# Flippy Spaceship - A Pixi-React v8 Game

**Flippy Spaceship** is a re-skinned version of the classic Flappy Bird game, featuring a space theme. Built using the latest [Pixi-React v8 Beta](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-react), this project brings a fresh and engaging look to the familiar gameplay.

Inspired by and translated from the original project, [Flappy Bird Game (Vue3 and PixiJS)](https://github.com/hairyf/vue3-pixi-flappy-bird/tree/main), this version shifts the aesthetic to a space-themed adventure while leveraging the power of Pixi-React.

This project also serves as an exploration of Pixi-React v8 Beta and is inspired by the [Web Game Challenge](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-game-off-2d-game-challenge-3dka) on Dev.to.
