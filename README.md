**Flippy Spaceship** is a re-skinned version of the classic Flappy Bird game, featuring a space theme. Built using the latest [Pixi-React v8 Beta](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-react/tree/beta), this project brings a fresh and engaging look to the familiar gameplay.

Inspired by and translated from the original project, [Flappy Bird Game (Vue3 and PixiJS)](https://github.com/hairyf/vue3-pixi-flappy-bird/tree/main), **Flippy Spaceship** retains the core mechanics of the original while shifting to a space adventure aesthetic. It’s designed not only as a fun game but also as a demonstration of what Pixi-React can do.

Check out the [Live Demo](https://flippy-spaceship.vercel.app).

This project also serves as an exploration of Pixi-React v8 Beta and is inspired by the [Web Game Challenge](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-game-off-2d-game-challenge-3dka) on Dev.to.
