**Flippy Spaceship** is a re-skinned version of the classic Flappy Bird game, featuring a space theme. Built using the latest [Pixi-React v8 Beta](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-react/tree/beta), this project brings a fresh and engaging look to the familiar gameplay.

This project was submitted to Dev.to’s [Web Game Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/webgame), Build a Game: Alien Edition.

Inspired by and translated from the original project, [Flappy Bird Game (Vue3 and PixiJS)](https://github.com/hairyf/vue3-pixi-flappy-bird/tree/main), I ported the codebase to React and leveraged the Pixi-React library to showcase its capabilities.

Check out the [Live Demo](https://flippy-spaceship.vercel.app). Use mouse clicks or the spacebar to play.
